Q1: What are the authentication and authorization requirements for different user roles?
A1: For the MVP, implement only one main role: regular users and administrators. Regular users should have access to their own content and public texts, while administrators need access to all content for moderation. Supabase Auth handles authentication with email/password and Google OAuth, and authorization can be managed through Row Level Security policies based on user roles stored in the users table.

Q2: How should we structure the relationship between users and their generated texts?
A2: Implement a one-to-many relationship where each text has a user_id foreign key referencing the users table. This allows easy queries to find all texts belonging to a specific user while maintaining data integrity.

Q3: How will the system track which questions a user has attempted and their performance?
A3: Create a user_responses table that records each answer attempt with fields for user_id, question_id, response_text, is_correct, and feedback. This allows tracking individual performance and generating aggregate statistics.

Q4: What attributes should be stored for each text?
A4: Store id, user_id (creator), content, language (enum), proficiency_level (enum), topic, visibility (public/private), created_at, updated_at, and word_count. Consider adding a title field for easier reference.

Q5: How should we handle the visibility of texts (public vs. private)?
A5: Add a visibility field (enum type with values 'public' and 'private') to the texts table. Use Row Level Security policies to ensure users can only access texts that are either public or created by themselves.

Q6: Do we need to store the AI-generated questions separately, or can they be generated on-demand?
A6: Store questions separately in a questions table to avoid regeneration costs, ensure consistency for reattempts, and enable analysis of question quality. Link them to texts with a foreign key relationship.

Q7: Should we implement any caching mechanism for frequently accessed texts or questions?
A7: Out of scope for MVP

Q8: How will user progress and learning history be tracked across different languages?
A8: Create a user_statistics table with fields for user_id, language, total_attempts, correct_answers, and last_activity_date. This enables tracking progress per language and provides data for personalized recommendations.

Q9: What metrics need to be stored for analyzing user performance?
A9: Store attempt_count, success_rate, average_response_time, proficiency_level_distribution, topic_performance, and session_frequency to enable comprehensive analysis of learning patterns and effectiveness.

Q10: How should we structure the relationship between texts and questions?
A10: Create a one-to-many relationship where questions table has a text_id foreign key referencing the texts table. This allows easy retrieval of all questions for a given text.

Q11: What constraints need to be in place to ensure data integrity?
A11: Implement NOT NULL constraints on essential fields, CHECK constraints for enum values (languages, proficiency levels), UNIQUE constraints for user emails, and Foreign Key constraints with appropriate ON DELETE behaviors.

Q12: Should we implement any soft delete mechanisms for user-deleted content?
A12: Yes, add an is_deleted boolean field with a default value of false to relevant tables. Use this for filtering queries instead of actually removing data, preserving the ability to recover content and maintaining referential integrity.

Q13: How should we handle user preferences for target languages?
A13: Create a user_preferences table with user_id, primary_language, learning_languages (array), and ui_language fields to store customizable settings separate from core user data.

Q14: What indexing strategy should be used to optimize common queries?
A14: Create indexes on frequently queried fields: user_id in texts and user_responses tables, language and visibility in texts table, and composite indexes for queries that filter on multiple fields simultaneously (e.g., language + visibility).

Q15: How will we implement Row Level Security to ensure users can only access appropriate content?
A15: Create RLS policies that: 1) Allow users to read any text with visibility='public', 2) Allow users to read/update/delete their own texts (auth.uid() = user_id), 3) Give administrators access to all content using a role-based condition.

<recommendations>
1. Implement a users table with authentication handled through Supabase Auth, storing only necessary profile information in the database.
2. Create a texts table that stores all generated content with foreign keys to the user who created it.
3. Use an enum type for language selection (initially English and Spanish) to ensure data consistency.
4. Implement another enum type for proficiency levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced).
5. Create a questions table linked to the corresponding texts with a foreign key relationship.
6. Add a user_responses table to track answers, feedback, and performance metrics.
7. Include a visibility field in the texts table to manage public/private status.
8. Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure users can only access their own private texts while allowing public access to shared content.
9. Use proper indexing on frequently queried fields such as user_id, language, and visibility status.
10. Implement constraints to enforce data integrity (e.g., proper language codes, valid proficiency levels).
11. Create a user_preferences table to store customizable user settings separated from authentication data.
12. Use timestamps for created_at and updated_at fields on all tables to track data lifecycle.
13. Consider implementing a tagging system for texts to improve searchability by topic.
14. Use Supabase realtime features for any collaborative or real-time feedback components.
15. Implement proper cascading delete rules to maintain referential integrity when users delete their content.
