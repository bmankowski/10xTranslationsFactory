  - Daily routines
  - Travel conversations

### 2. Question Generation
- Generate questions for each text:
  - 4 open questions

### 3. Simple Answer System
- Text-based input only

### 4. Basic AI Assessment
- Simple correct/incorrect evaluation
- Basic feedback for wrong answers

### 5. User Authentication
- Simple sign-up/login functionality
- Google OAuth integration
- User profiles with basic information
- Session management
- Authentication functionalities:
  - Email/password registration
  - Google OAuth sign-in
  - Password reset
  - Email verification
  - Authentication state persistence
  - Protected routes for authenticated users
  - User profile management (basic info, preferences)
  - Session timeout handling
