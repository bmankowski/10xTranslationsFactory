# AI-Powered Language Learning Platform

## Project Overview
The project aims to create an interactive language learning platform that leverages AI to generate personalized content and provide immediate feedback to learners.

## Core Features

### 1. AI Text Generation
- Generate engaging, context-appropriate texts in multiple languages
- Texts can be customized based on:
  - User's proficiency level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
  - Specific topics or themes of interest
  - Target vocabulary or grammar concepts

### 2. Question Generation
- Automatically create various types of questions based on the generated text:
  - Multiple choice questions
  - Fill-in-the-blank exercises
  - True/False statements
  - Open-ended questions
  - Grammar-focused questions
- Questions will be available in both the target language and user's native language
- Difficulty levels will adapt based on user performance

### 3. Interactive Answer System
- Users can input answers in their chosen language
- Support for text input with special characters and accents
- Voice input option for pronunciation practice
- Real-time spell checking and basic grammar suggestions

### 4. AI Assessment & Feedback
- Immediate evaluation of user responses
- Detailed feedback on:
  - Grammar mistakes
