<questions>
For language and proficiency selection, should these controls be placed on a single “Generate Exercise” screen or separated into an initial settings step?
Do we need a global language toggle (UI language) distinct from the target learning language selection for content?
Should users be able to navigate back to previous questions within an exercise, or only move forward one question at a time?
How should public/private visibility be surfaced in the generation flow—via a toggle on the same form or a separate “Share Settings” step?
For browsing past exercises, do we need infinite scroll, pagination, or a filterable table/list UI?
What error-handling patterns should UI adopt for AI failures—inline retry buttons, modals, or full-page error states?
Are there specific accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG levels) we must meet for form inputs and navigation?
Should user preferences (primary language, UI language) be editable in a persistent profile view or inline within the header/nav?
Do we anticipate supporting mobile-first interactions such as swipe gestures between questions?
What performance or caching strategy is preferred when fetching large lists of texts and questions (e.g., client-side caching, pagination cursors)?
How should authenticated and unauthenticated states be represented in the layout—redirect to login page versus inline login prompts?
Do we require real-time UI feedback (e.g., progress indicators or toast notifications) for long-running AI generation operations?
Should we support light/dark mode (or custom themes), and if so, where should the toggle live?
Do we want users to be able to adjust font size or line spacing for readability?
How should AI vs. user messages be visually differentiated (color, shape, avatar, alignment)?
Do we prefer a full-width chat panel or a card-based layout for each message?
Should long passages of generated text scroll independently, or expand inline with the chat?
Would a stepper or progress bar (e.g., “Question 2 of 4”) improve clarity?
Should users ever replay or edit past answers, or only move strictly forward?
How should correct vs. incorrect answers be highlighted (e.g., color-coded borders, icons, inline annotations)?
Would you like an optional “Show hint” or “Explain why” button when feedback is shown?
In “My Exercises,” should filters (language, visibility, date) be inline chips, a sidebar, or a dropdown?
Do we need bulk actions (e.g., delete multiple texts, export selected texts) in the list view?
How should public texts be surfaced (e.g., grid of cards, infinite feed, paginated list)?
Should there be “Like” or “Comment” affordances on public texts in a community view?
Should Enter submit the answer, or require a click? Any keyboard shortcuts (e.g., ⌘+Enter)?
Do we want swipe gestures on mobile for “Next”/“Back,” or arrow-key support on desktop?
Beyond WCAG A, do we need specific ARIA live regions for chat updates?
How should focus move between the chat, input field, and controls to optimize keyboard-only users?
What should an empty “My Exercises” state look like (illustration, call-to-action, or tips)?
If AI fails mid-generation, do we show a retry button inline, or collapse into a full-page error?
When we localize UI labels, do we load them dynamically or build separate static pages?
Should we preview UI-language changes immediately, or require a page reload?
</questions>
<recommendations>
Define a primary layout with a header (logo, UI language toggle, user avatar) and a sidebar for navigation between “Generate Exercise,” “My Exercises,” and “Profile.”
Implement a single-page “Generate Exercise” view with form controls for target language, proficiency level, topic input, and visibility toggle, using Shadcn/ui form components.
Use a stepper component to guide users through Text → Question 1…Question 4 flows, with progress indicator and “Next” and “Back” buttons.
Fetch data with React query or SWR for caching and stale-while-revalidate patterns, supporting pagination for exercise lists.
Build protected routes in Astro middleware that redirect unauthenticated users to a login page using Supabase Auth.
Create reusable UI components for TextDisplay, QuestionCard, and FeedbackMessage, each handling loading, success, and error states.
Ensure responsive layout via Tailwind CSS breakpoints: collapse sidebar to a bottom nav on mobile, stack form fields vertically.
Leverage Astro layouts to statically render non-interactive pages (e.g., login, profile) and mount React components only where dynamic behavior is needed.
Implement error and retry UI patterns: inline retry buttons for individual API calls and global toast notifications for critical failures.
Integrate accessible ARIA labels and keyboard navigation into all form components, targeting WCAG AA compliance.
Use context or a React state management library to persist current exercise state (text, questions, answers) across component reloads.
Provide a profile page that fetches and displays user preferences and learning languages, allowing inline edits via the /api/users/me/preferences and /api/users/me/learning-languages endpoints.
Skip light/dark mode and font-size adjustments for the MVP.
Display AI messages as right-aligned light-blue chat bubbles and user messages as left-aligned light-green chat bubbles in a full-width panel, with generated text expanding inline.
Remove backward navigation controls; after a correct answer is confirmed, automatically advance to the next question; include a “Next” button to skip a question.
Style incorrect feedback with light-red highlights and correct feedback with light-green highlights.
Omit filters and bulk actions in the MVP.
Use a paginated list view without like/comment features for the MVP.
Submit answers on Enter key; do not implement mobile swipe gestures for the MVP.
Rely on standard tab focus ordering; do not add additional ARIA live regions.
Show a call-to-action in empty states; display an inline retry button if AI generation fails.
Load UI label translations dynamically so that changes take effect immediately.

1. on a single page
2. yes
3. move forward only, in a window in a form of a discussion between tutor and user
4. just toggle private/shared
5. list with pagination of items
6. for small errors let's use communiates, for big errors full-page error states
7. Waht is WCAG levels?
8. within profile
9. no
10. pagination
11. redirect to login page and coming back to desired page after login
12. we need indiocator, that AI is working

<questions>
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) define three conformance levels—A, AA, and AAA—each increasing in strictness. Which level should we target for your MVP?
For the AI “working” indicator, do you prefer a spinner overlay, a skeleton placeholder, or a progress bar?
In the tutor-style discussion window, should we display the full conversation history for context, or only show the current AI prompt and user response at any time?
</questions>
<recommendations>
Build the “Generate Exercise” and Q&A flows on a single page, using a chat-style UI component that renders AI messages (text + questions) as tutor bubbles and user inputs below. Disable backward navigation to enforce forward-only progression.
Use Shadcn/ui form components for the initial controls (language, proficiency, topic, private/shared toggle) and position them at the top of the page in a collapsible panel.
Implement a loading indicator component that can swap between spinner, skeleton, or progress bar based on your later preference. Show it during AI text/question generation and answer evaluation.
Develop a paginated “My Exercises” list view using React Query (or SWR) with page controls (prev/next) to fetch /api/texts with limit and offset.
Create two error UI patterns: inline toast notifications for validation or minor API hiccups, and a full-page error layout for major failures (e.g., AI generation errors or auth issues).
Enforce WCAG compliance at your chosen level (A, AA, or AAA) by applying accessible ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, color-contrast checks, and focus management.
Place the UI-language selection control within the Profile page, integrating with /api/users/me/preferences, and ensure changes persist immediately.
Use Astro layouts for static pages (login, profile) and mount React chat and form components only where dynamic interaction is needed.
Configure Astro middleware to guard protected routes, redirect unauthenticated users to /login, and on successful login, return them to their original target page.
Ensure responsive design via Tailwind CSS: collapse sidebar to a bottom tab bar on narrow viewports, stack controls vertically, and scale chat bubbles for readability on mobile.
Maintain exercise state (current text, questions, answers) in React context or a lightweight state store so that page reloads or hot-module updates do not lose progress.
