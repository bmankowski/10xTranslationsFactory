## # Product Requirements Document (PRD) - AI-Powered Language Learning Platform

## 1. Product Overview
The AI-Powered Language Learning Platform is an interactive educational tool that leverages artificial intelligence to generate personalized language learning content and provide immediate feedback to users learning English and Spanish. The platform aims to make language learning more engaging, effective, and tailored to individual needs by utilizing AI for text generation, question creation, and assessment in both English and Spanish.

This platform will initially support English and Spanish with a simple set of features that will validate the core concept and provide value to users from day one. The MVP will include basic text generation on user-defined topics and selected proficiency levels for English and Spanish, question generation for comprehension practice presented one by one, a text-based answer system, fundamental assessment capabilities, and user authentication with Google OAuth integration.

## 2. User Problem
Language learners face several challenges with traditional learning methods:

- Generic learning materials that don't match their interests or proficiency level in their target language (English or Spanish)
- Limited practice opportunities with real-world language contexts for their chosen language (English or Spanish)
- Delayed feedback on their language usage and comprehension
- Lack of personalization in their learning journey
- Difficulty maintaining motivation without engaging content
- Limited access to conversation partners for practice in their target language (English or Spanish)

The AI-Powered Language Learning Platform addresses these problems by providing on-demand, customizable learning materials with immediate feedback in English and Spanish. By using AI to generate relevant content and assess user responses, the platform creates a responsive learning environment that adapts to the user's needs across English and Spanish.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### Text and questions generation
- FR-001: The system must generate texts of 100-200 words using appropriate AI APIs (e.g., OpenAI, or potentially others depending on the language), considering the user-selected target language (English or Spanish) and proficiency level (beginner, intermediate, advanced). In the event of API failure, the system should display a clear error message and offer a retry option.
- FR-002: The system must allow users to select their target language from the supported options: English and Spanish.
- FR-003: The system must allow users to input any topic for text generation in their selected target language.
- FR-004: The system must display the generated text clearly on the user interface.
- FR-005: The system must generate 4 open questions based on each generated text in the same target language (English or Spanish).
- FR-006: The system must display one question at a time clearly after the text is presented.

### Answer System
- FR-007: The system must provide a text input interface for users to submit an answer to the currently displayed question in the target language (English or Spanish).
- FR-008: The system must accept and process user-submitted answers in the target language (English or Spanish).
- FR-009: The system must maintain the context between the generated text, the current question, and the submitted answer, all within the selected target language (English or Spanish).

### Assessment and Feedback
- FR-010: The system must evaluate user answers as correct or incorrect, taking into account the nuances of the target language (English or Spanish).
- FR-011: The system must provide actionable, clear feedback for incorrect answers, offering specific guidance for user improvement in the target language (English or Spanish).
- FR-012: The system must present the assessment result for the current question clearly to the user before proceeding to the next question.

### User Interface
- FR-013: The interface must be intuitive and easy to navigate, with clear language selection options for English and Spanish.
- FR-014: The system must provide clear instructions for users at each step in their chosen language (English or Spanish).

### Authentication and User Management
- FR-017: The system must provide user registration via email/password and Google OAuth.

### Text Visibility and Reattempt
- FR-024: The system must allow users to set the visibility of a generated text (in English or Spanish) as either public or private (belonging to the user) at the time of generation. If set to public, the text may be displayed in community feeds; if private, it remains accessible only to the user.
- FR-025: The system must provide functionality for users to browse and select previously generated texts (in English or Spanish) and attempt answering the associated questions for continued practice.
- FR-026: The system must provide a list view where users can see all texts generated by them (in English or Spanish) as well as all public texts, with the ability to filter by language and delete texts they have created.
