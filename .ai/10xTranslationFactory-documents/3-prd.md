# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - AI-Powered Language Learning Platform

## 1. Product Overview
The AI-Powered Language Learning Platform is an interactive educational tool that leverages artificial intelligence to generate personalized language learning content and provide immediate feedback to users. The platform aims to make language learning more engaging, effective, and tailored to individual needs by utilizing AI for text generation, question creation, and assessment.

This platform will initially focus on English language learning with a simple set of features that will validate the core concept and provide value to users from day one. The MVP will include basic text generation on predefined topics, question generation for comprehension practice, a text-based answer system, and fundamental assessment capabilities.

## 2. User Problem
Language learners face several challenges with traditional learning methods:

- Generic learning materials that don't match their interests or proficiency level
- Limited practice opportunities with real-world language contexts
- Delayed feedback on their language usage and comprehension
- Lack of personalization in their learning journey
- Difficulty maintaining motivation without engaging content
- Limited access to conversation partners for practice

The AI-Powered Language Learning Platform addresses these problems by providing on-demand, customizable learning materials with immediate feedback. By using AI to generate relevant content and assess user responses, the platform creates a responsive learning environment that adapts to the user's needs.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### Text Generation
- FR-001: The system must generate intermediate-level texts of 100-200 words using OpenAI's API. In the event of API failure, the system should display a clear error message and offer a retry option.
- FR-002: The system must offer two predefined topics (Daily routines and Travel conversations)
- FR-003: The system must display the generated text clearly on the user interface

### Question Generation
- FR-004: The system must generate 4 open questions based on each generated text
- FR-005: The system must display questions clearly after the text is presented

### Answer System
- FR-006: The system must provide a text input interface for users to submit answers
- FR-007: The system must accept and process user-submitted answers
- FR-008: The system must maintain the context between the generated text, questions, and answers

### Assessment and Feedback
- FR-009: The system must evaluate user answers as correct or incorrect .
- FR-010: The system must provide actionable, clear feedback for incorrect answers, offering specific guidance for user improvement.
- FR-011: The system must present assessment results clearly to the user

### User Interface
- FR-012: The interface must be intuitive and easy to navigate
- FR-013: The system must provide clear instructions for users at each step
- FR-014: The system must display error messages when issues occur

- System provides basic feedback for incorrect answers
- Feedback is displayed clearly to the user
- User can see both their answer and the feedback together

### US-005
**Title:** Navigate Between Steps

**Description:** As a language learner, I want to easily navigate through the learning process so that I can focus on learning rather than figuring out the interface.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can move from text generation to answering questions with clear navigation
- User can start over with a new text after completing the current exercise
- Navigation controls are intuitive and clearly labeled
- System maintains state appropriately during navigation

### US-006
